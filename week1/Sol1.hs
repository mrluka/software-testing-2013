 --if none of previous holds, recursively call function again with m xs. (No empty list and the search was also false on the first item of list. Now, call removeFst1 again with the rest of the initial list, starting without head of initial list.

-- > Ex 1.3 (Put divides in file prime.hs, but already in GS.hs)
-- > Ex 1.4 ()
-- Exercise 1.4
-- Replace k^2 > n with k^2>= n, would it make any difference?
-- WRONG: It would make a difference because then the function would work for all n.
-- If called "ld 4", then, in the first version there would be a wrong result because ldf would
-- recursively call itself again with ldf 3 4 what will not give a valid result, so the secont solution with 
-- k^2 >= n is right.
-- RIGHT: No difference, first line captures the case with "2"
-- > Ex 1.4 part 2 (in GS.hs)
-- > Ex 1.5 (Add definitions to prime.hs, ...but are already in GS.hs)
-- > Ex 1.6
-- rem :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool
-- > Ex 1.7
-- The type definition of divides is: Integer-> Integer-> Bool.
-- "divides 5" is type of Integer-> Integer because that is what the function returns with one parameter. By adding another parameter, such as "divides 5 7", then first "divides 5" with argument "5" will be executed and produces the result Integer-> Bool, which is then called with "7" as formal argument, which then produces Bool.
